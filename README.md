WeiweiWeb
=========

## Who

We are all fans of Ai Weiwei and we wanted to make a nice website that anyone can help share with other Ai Weiwei fans.

## What

This is a simple website based upon some [free shared technology](https://github.com/aiweiwei/weiweiweb) that allows anyone to share the simple message on his or her web hosting space with the simple use of git.

## Where

This site is hosted at <http://weiweiweb.org> and many more sites will be coming online in the coming days and weeks. [Clone our site](https://github.com/aiweiwei/weiweiweb)!

## When

You can help out on this project anytime you want to! You can even fork our repository and share your own site!

## Why

We love Ai Weiwei and we want to help him spread his message around the world. 

## How

We are using technology like <http://github.com>, [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), and [Git](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_\(software\)) to make this site simple and easy to share.

### Get the code

You can [Clone us on Github](https://github.com/aiweiwei/weiweiweb) or [Download](https://github.com/aiweiwei/weiweiweb/zipball/master) the code.

The site has the following requirements:

* Ruby
* [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/Install)
* [Atom Tools](https://github.com/bct/atom-tools/wiki/)

After you install the software you can read [how to use Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/Usage).

If you want to use Jekyll to generate your own copy of the site and host it on your own, you should first edit the <code>_config.yml</code> and change the line that reads <code>url: http://weiweiweb.org</code> to point to the domain where you want to host this site.

### Help Translate

You can help us translate this site. You can find all the posts inside the <code>en/\_posts</code> folder or [view it online](https://github.com/aiweiwei/weiweiweb/tree/master/en/_posts). To translate the posts into your own language, make a copy of the <code>en</code> folder and rename it to the [two-letter language code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1) for your language. Then open up each document inside the <code>_posts</code> folder and translate the title, description and main content.

If you know how to use git and Github, you can commit your translations and make a pull request. If not, you can just send us the translations or post them to our [issue tracker](https://github.com/aiweiwei/weiweiweb/issues).
